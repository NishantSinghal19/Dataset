## API EndPoints

Here I am explaining all the APIs that have been created and how to use them
1. 'POST /login': Here it requires a body in JSON format which needs a username and password and will generate the required token in authorization.
**SS - Summary Statistics** It essentially means 3 values (mean, min, max)
Now all these APIs require an authentication token
2. 'POST /add-record': It is used to add a record in the dataset
3. 'DELETE /delete-record': It is used to delete the record from the data set.
4. 'GET /summary-salary': It is used to fetch SS for salary over the entire dataset
5. 'GET /contract-summary-salary': It is used to fetch SS for salary for records which satisfy "on_contract": "true"
6. 'GET /department-summary-salary': It is used to fetch SS for salary for each department.
7. 'GET /nested-department-summary-salary': It is used to fetch SS for the salary for each department and sub-department combination

## Authentication 

It is done using the Bearer token generated while login

## Dataset
